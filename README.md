# blinkenlights: blink up to 8 powerful LED lights simultaneously with an Arduino Pro Mini

* Independent patterns
* Directly controlled light: if selected with jumper, one light channel can be switched on/off with RC PWM signal. This can be used for a floodlight or landing light.
* Support for 2 different modes (FLYING, STANDBY). Different patterns for each. Switching modes by RC PWM channel.
